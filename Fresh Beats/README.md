**Findings**: 
User Engagement & Conversion: 
  â€¢Paid users are more engaged with better retention; a key strategy to improve business would be to convert free users to paid users. 
  â€¢ Indie is popular with paid users while rock is popular with free users; tailoring recommendations per user and offering a rock listeners 
    incentives to upgrade usership is key in converstion. 
  â€¢  Hip-hop popularity is on the rise while pop is declining; Fresh Beats should consider when tailoring recommendations and artist promotions. 
  
**Recommendations**: 

**Users by Genre Focus**
Marketing should try focused campaigns targeting typical demographics for fans of these genres.
It is worth doing deeper research into previous years to understand why pop is on a downwards trend.
Product/marketing teams should try experiments to generate leads in alternative genres.

**Tracks Focus**
Paid users are very valuable, so it is worth offering time-limited promotions and other deals to convert users from free to paid.
Offer users a referral marketing option, so they can get a free trial of the paid tier by referring new users.

**Genre Focus**
Try promotions focused on rock that offer free trials to convert to paid users.
We should analyze more ways to increase the engagement of rock-listening users, as a potential growth segment.
We should analyze user retention in these genres, and consider how we can maximize it.
Indie is particularly popular with paid users, so focus promotions there.
